# Datadumper

Simple mod to dump data that `--reports` doesn't already include into JSON

I couldn't get `--reports` to work with fabric, and fabric seems to use it's own flags with `-Dfabric-api.datagen` anyways.

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
